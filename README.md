# Cookiecutter for flask

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/on3iro/cookiecutter-flask.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/on3iro/cookiecutter-flask)

This is a simple cookiecutter for flask. It is still a work in progress, but should work fine already. I drew a lot of inspiration from [slorias cookiecutter](https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-flask).

Detailed instructions of how to use this cookiecutter will follow...
